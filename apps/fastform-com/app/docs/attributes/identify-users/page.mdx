# Identifying Users

At Fastform, we value user privacy. By default, Fastform doesn't collect or store any personal information from your users. However, we understand that it can be helpful for you to know which user submitted the feedback and also functionality like recontacting users and controlling the waiting period between surveys requires identifying the users. That's why we provide a way for you to share existing user data from your app, so you can view it in our dashboard.

If you would like to use the User Identification feature of Fastform, target surveys to specific user segments and see more information about the user who responded to a form, you can identify users by setting a User ID, email, and custom attributes. This guide will walk you through how to do that.

## Setting User ID

To enable the User identification feature you need to set the `userId` in the init() call of Fastform. Only when the `userId` is set the person will be visible in the Fastform dashboard. The `userId` can be any string and it's best to use the default identifier you use in your app (e.g. unique id from database or the email address if it's unique) but you can also anonymize these as long as they are unique for every user.

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Setting User ID">

```javascript
fastform.init({
  environmentId: "<environment-id>",
  apiHost: "<api-host>",
  userId: "<user_id>",
});
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
## Setting User Email

The `userId` is the main identifier used in Fastform and user identification is only enabled when it is set. In addition to the userId you can also set attributes that describes the user better. The email address can be set using the setEmail function:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Setting Email">

```javascript
fastform.setEmail("user@example.com");
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
### Setting Custom User Attributes

You can use the setAttribute function to set any custom attribute for the user (e.g. name, plan, etc.):

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Setting Custom Attributes">

```javascript
fastform.setAttribute("Plan", "free");
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
### Logging Out Users

When a user logs out of your webpage, make sure to log them out of Fastform as well. This will prevent new activity from being associated with an incorrect user. Use the logout function:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Logging out User">

```javascript
fastform.logout();
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
