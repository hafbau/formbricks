#### Best Practices

# Learn from Churn

Churn is hard, but can teach you a lot. Whenever a user decides that your product isn’t worth it anymore, you have a unique opportunity to get deep insights. These insights are pure gold to reduce churn.

## Purpose

The Churn Form is among the most effective ways to identify weaknesses in your offering. People were willing to pay but now are not anymore: What changed? Let’s find out!

## Preview

<DemoPreview template="Churn Form" />

## Fastform Approach

- Ask at exactly the right point in time
- Follow-up to prevent bad reviews
- Coming soon: Make form mandatory

## Overview

To run the Churn Form in your app you want to proceed as follows:

1. Create new Churn Form at [app.fastform.com](http://app.fastform.com/)
2. Set up the user action to display form at right point in time
3. Choose correct recontact options to never miss a feedback
4. Prevent that churn!

<Note>
  ## Fastform Widget running?
  We assume that you have already installed the Fastform Widget in your web app. It’s required to display messages
  and forms in your app. If not, please follow the [Quick Start Guide (takes 15mins max.)](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-in-app-form)
</Note>

### 1. Create new Churn Form

If you don't have an account yet, create one at [app.fastform.com](https://app.fastform.com/auth/signup)

Click on "Create Form" and choose the template “Churn Form”:

<Image
  src={CreateChurnFlow}
  alt="Create churn form by template"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### 2. Update questions (if you like)

You’re free to update the question and answer options. However, based on our experience, we suggest giving the provided template a go 😊

<Image
  src={ChangeText}
  alt="Change text content"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

_Want to change the button color? You can do so in the product settings._

Save, and move over to the “Audience” tab.

### 3. Pre-segment your audience

In this case, you don’t really need to pre-segment your audience. You likely want to ask everyone who hits the “Cancel subscription” button.

### 4. Set up a trigger

To create the trigger for your Churn Form, you have two options to choose from:

1. **Trigger by innerText:** You likely have a “Cancel Subscription” button in your app. You can setup a user Action with the according `innerText` to trigger the form, like so:

<Image
  src={TriggerInnerText}
  alt="Set the trigger by inner Text"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

2. **Trigger by CSS Selector:** In case you have more than one button saying “Cancel Subscription” in your app and only want to display the form when one of them is clicked, you want to be more specific. The best way to do that is to give this button the HTML `id=“cancel-subscription”` and set your user action up like so:

<Image
  src={TriggerCSS}
  alt="Set the trigger by CSS Selector"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

3. **Trigger by pageURL:** Lastly, you could also display your form on a subpage “/subscription-cancelled” where you forward users once they cancelled the trial subscription. You can then create a user Action with the type `pageURL` with the following settings:

<Image
  src={TriggerPageUrl}
  alt="Set the trigger by page URL"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Whenever a user visits this page, matches the filter conditions above and the recontact options (below) the form will be displayed ✅

Here is our complete [Actions manual](/docs/actions/why) covering [Code](/docs/actions/code) and [No-Code](/docs/actions/no-code) Actions.

<Note>
  ## Pre-churn flow coming soon 
  We’re currently building full-screen form pop-ups. You’ll be able to prevent users from closing the form
  unless they respond to it. It’s certainly debatable if you want that but you could force them to click through
  the form before letting them cancel 🤷
</Note>

### 5. Select Action in the “When to ask” card

<Image
  src={SelectAction}
  alt="Select feedback button action"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### 6. Last step: Set Recontact Options correctly

Lastly, scroll down to “Recontact Options”. Here you have to choose the correct settings to make sure you milk these super valuable insights. You want to make sure that this form is always displayed, no matter if the user has already seen a form in the past days:

<Image
  src={RecontactOptions}
  alt="Set recontact options"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

These settings make sure the form is always displayed, when a user wants to Cancel their subscription.

### 7. Congrats! You’re ready to publish your form 💃

<Image
  src={Publishform}
  alt="Publish form"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

<Note>
  ## Fastform Widget running? 
  You need to have the Fastform Widget installed to display the Churn Form in your app. Please follow [this
  tutorial (Step 4 onwards)](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-in-app-form) to install the widget.
