#### Best Practices

# Feature Chaser

Following up on specific features only makes sense with very targeted surveys. Fastform is built for that.

## Purpose

Product analytics never tell you why a feature is used - and why not. Following up on specific features with highly relevant questions is a great way to gather feedback and improve your product.

## Preview

<DemoPreview template="Feature Chaser" />

## Fastform Approach

- Trigger form at exactly the right point in the user journey
- Never ask twice, keep your data clean
- Prevent form fatigue with global waiting period

## Overview

To run the Feature Chaser form in your app you want to proceed as follows:

1. Create new Feature Chaser form at [app.fastform.com](http://app.fastform.com/)
2. Setup a user action to display form at the right point in time

<Note>
  ## Fastform Widget running? 
  We assume that you have already installed the Fastform Widget in your web app. It’s required to display messages
  and surveys in your app. If not, please follow the [Quick Start Guide (takes 15mins max.)](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-in-app-form)
</Note>

### 1. Create new Feature Chaser

If you don't have an account yet, create one at [app.fastform.com](https://app.fastform.com/auth/signup)

Click on "Create Form" and choose the template “Feature Chaser”:

<Image
  src={CreateSurvey}
  alt="Create form by template"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### 2. Update questions

The questions you want to ask are dependent on your feature and can be very specific. In the template, we suggest a high-level check on how easy it was for the user to achieve their goal. We also add an opportunity to provide context:

<Image
  src={ChangeText}
  alt="Change text content"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Save, and move over to where the magic happens: The “Audience” tab.

### 3. Set up a trigger for the Feature Chaser form:

Before setting the right trigger, you need to identify a user action in your app which signals, that they have just used the feature you want to understand better. In most cases, it is clicking a specific button in your product.

You can create [Code Actions](/docs/actions/code) and [No Code Actions](/docs/actions/no-code) to follow users through your app. In this example, we will create a No Code Action.

There are two ways to track a button:

1. **Trigger by innerText:** You might have a button with a unique text at the end of your feature e.g. "Export Report". You can setup a user Action with the according `innerText` to trigger the form, like so:

<Image
  src={ActionText}
  alt="Set the trigger by inner Text"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

2. **Trigger by CSS Selector:** In case you have more than one button saying “Export Report” in your app and only want to display the form when one of them is clicked, you want to be more specific. The best way to do that is to give this button the HTML `id=“export-report-featurename”` and set your user action up like so:

<Image
  src={ActionCSS}
  alt="Set the trigger by CSS Selector"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Please follow our [Actions manual](/docs/actions/why) for an in-depth description of how Actions work.

### 4. Select Action in the “When to ask” card

<Image
  src={SelectAction}
  alt="Select PMF trigger button action"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### 5. Last step: Set Recontact Options correctly

Lastly, scroll down to “Recontact Options”. Here you have full freedom to decide who you want to ask. Generally, you only want to ask every user once and prevent form fatigue. It's up to you to decide if you want to ask again, when the user did not yet reply:

<Image
  src={RecontactOptions}
  alt="Set recontact options"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

### 7. Congrats! You’re ready to publish your form 💃

<Image src={Publish} alt="Publish form" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

<Note>
  ## Fastform Widget running? 
  You need to have the Fastform Widget installed to display the Feature Chaser in your app. Please follow [this
  tutorial (Step 4 onwards)](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-in-app-form) to install the widget.
