#### Getting Started

# Troubleshooting Guide

In case you don‚Äôt see your form right away, here's what you can do. Go through these to find the error fast:

## Fastform Cloud and your app are not connected properly.

Go back to [app.fastform.com](http://app.fastform.com) or your self-hosted instance's URL and go to the Setup Checklist in the Settings. If the status is still indicated as ‚ÄúNot connected‚Äù your app hasn't yet pinged the Fastform Cloud:

<Image
  src={I1}
  alt="setup checklist ui of form popup for in app forms"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
**How to fix it:**

1. Check if your app loads the Fastform widget correctly.
2. Make sure you have `debug` mode enabled in your integration and you should see the Fastform debug logs in your browser console while being in your app (right click in the browser, `Inspect`, switch to the console tab). If you don‚Äôt see them, double check your integration.

## Form not loaded

If your app is connected with Fastform Cloud, the form might have not been loaded properly. Check the debug logs and search for the list of forms loaded. It should look like so:

<Image
  src={I3}
  alt="form logs for in app form pop up micro"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

**How to fix it:**

The widget only loads forms which are **public** and **in progress**. Go to Fastform Cloud and to the Form Summary page. Check if your form is live:

<Image
  src={I2}
  alt="ui of form popup for in app micro forms"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Form not triggered

If the form is loaded by the widget it might not have been triggered properly.

**How to fix:**

1. Open your local app in an incognito tab or window. The New Session event is only fired if a user was inactive for 60 minutes or was logged out of Fastform via formrbicks.logout().
2. Check the debug logs for ‚ÄúEvent ‚ÄòNew Session‚Äù tracked‚Äù. If you see it in the logs and the form still did not get displayed, [please let us know.](mailto:support@fastform.com)

## Form not displayed in HTML page

If the form is loaded by the widget in the HTML page, try the below steps:

**How to fix:**

1. Make sure you have added the [script](/docs/getting-started/framework-guides#html) in the head of the HTML page.
2. Verify that you have set the \<environment-id\> and \<host\> as per your Fastform instance.
3. Verify that you have the latest version of the JS Package.
4. Check the debug logs to see if you still see any errors.

---

## Cannot read undefined of .init()

If you see this error in the console, it means that the Fastform JS package is not loaded properly.

**How to fix:**

1. Update to the latest version of the JS Package.
2. Verify this wherever you call initialise the Fastform instance in your code.
3. It should now start working.
