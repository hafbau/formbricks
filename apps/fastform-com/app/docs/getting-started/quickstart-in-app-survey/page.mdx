#### Getting Started

# Quickstart

In app surveys have 6-10x better conversion rates than emailed out surveys. This tutorial explains how to run an in app form in your web app in 10 to 15 minutes. Let’s go!

## Create a free Fastform Cloud account

While you can [self-host](/docs/self-hosting/deployment) Fastform, the quickest and easiest way to get started is with the free Cloud plan. Just [sign up here](https://app.fastform.com/auth/signup) and click through the onboarding, until you’re here:

  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
/>

## Create your first form

To be able to see a form in your app, you need to create one. We’ll choose one of the templates and head over to the form settings:

  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

As you can see in the orange note here, we have not yet connected Fastform Cloud with our app. We will do so in just a minute, let’s first setup the form correctly.

Select “Web App” in the How to ask settings:

<Image
  src={I3}
  alt="Form settings for popup micro surve"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Scroll down to Form Trigger and choose “New Session”. This will cause this form to appear when the Fastform Widget tracks a new user session:

<Image
  src={I4}
  alt="In app form trigger for feedback popup micro form"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

In **Recontact Options** we choose the following settings, so that we can play around with the form more easily. By default, each form will be shown only once to each user to prevent form fatigue:

<Image
  src={I5}
  alt="Options for form popup in app micro form"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Now hit **Publish** and you’ll be forwarded to the Summary Page. This is where you’ll find the responses to this form. On the Summary Page click through to the Setup Checklist:

<Image
  src={I6}
  alt="pop up form settings for inapp web form"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Set up the Fastform Widget in your app

On the Setup Checklist you have two elements. At the top you find the Widget Status Indicator. Once your app is connected to Fastform Cloud successfully, this will turn green:

<Image
  src={I7}
  alt="feedback popup in app form"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

In the manual below, this code snippet contains all the information you need:

- The **Environment ID** of your current Fastform workspace
- The **API Host** which is ‘https://app.fastform.com’ for Cloud users

<Image
  src={I8}
  alt="settings for in app form popping up"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

If you like to use the user identification feature, please follow the [user identification guide](/docs/attributes/identify-users).

## Load Fastform widget in your app

In a local instance of your app, you'll embed the Fastform Widget. Dependent on your frontend tech, the setup differs a bit:

- [Next.JS App Directory](/docs/getting-started/framework-guides#next-js)
- [Next.JS Pages Directory](/docs/getting-started/framework-guides#next-js)
- [React (Create React App)](/docs/getting-started/framework-guides#react-js)
- [Vue.JS](/docs/getting-started/framework-guides#vue-js)

## Restart your app and open browser console

Now, restart your app in your terminal to make sure the widget is loaded. Once its loaded, open the browser console to see the Fastform debug logs. If you did everything right, you should now see your form in the lower right corner:
