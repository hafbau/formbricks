#### Introduction

# How Fastform works

Fastform is a powerful platform designed to help you create and manage in-product micro-forms for SaaS and digital products. Here is an overview:

### Four components

1. **Form Builder**: Create and customize your forms with a user-friendly, no-code interface.
2. **Targeting & Triggers**: Define specific user segments and set event-based triggers to display your forms to the right users at the right time.
3. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate Fastform into your web or mobile application using the provided SDKs or the HTML snippet.
4. **Analytics & Insights**: Analyze user responses and gain actionable insights to make informed product decisions.

## Form Builder

The Form Builder is where you create and customize your micro-forms. With its intuitive drag-and-drop interface, you can easily add different question types, set response options, and apply your branding to the form forms. The Form Builder allows you to preview your form in real-time, ensuring it looks and feels perfect for your users.

## Targeting & Triggers

Fastform offers fine-grained user targeting and event-based triggers to help you display your forms to the most relevant audience. Using the platform, you can define user segments based on attributes and behaviors, and set up triggers to show your forms at specific moments within your product. This ensures that you're capturing the most accurate and valuable feedback possible.

## Integration

Integrating Fastform into your web or mobile application is a breeze. With SDKs for popular web frameworks like React, and an HTML snippet for non-framework based websites, you can quickly add Fastform to your project. The provided code snippets make it easy to initialize the Fastform widget and configure it to communicate with your backend.

## Analytics & Insights

Fastform provides powerful analytics and insights to help you understand user responses and make data-driven decisions. The platform aggregates form results and presents them in an easy-to-understand format, enabling you to identify trends, spot issues, and uncover opportunities for improvement. With Fastform, you're always one step ahead in understanding your users and optimizing your product experience.
