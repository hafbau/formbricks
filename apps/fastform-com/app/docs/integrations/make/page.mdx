#### Integrations

# Make.com Setup

Make is a powerful tool to send information between Fastform and thousands of apps. Here's how to set it up.

<Note>
  ### Nail down your form first ? 
  Any changes in the form cause additional work in the _Scenario_. It
  makes sense to first settle on the form you want to run and then get to setting up Make.
</Note>

## Step 1: Setup your form incl. `questionId` for every question

Set up the `questionId`s of your form questions before publishing.

<Image
  src={UpdateQuestionId}
  alt="Update Question ID"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

_Update the Question ID field in every question card under Advanced Settings._

<Note>
  ### Already published? Duplicate form 
  You can only update the questionId before publishing the form. If
  already published, simply duplicate it.
  <Image
    src={Duplicateform}
    alt="Duplicate Form"
    quality="100"
    className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
  />
</Note>

## Step 2: Setup Make.com

Visit [Make.com](https://make.com) to start a new scenario.

<Image
  src={CreateNewScenario}
  alt="Create New Scenario"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Search for `Fastform`:

<Image
  src={SearchFastform}
  alt="Search Fastform"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Choose the event to trigger the Scenario:

<Image
  src={SelectTriggers}
  alt="Select Triggers"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Step 3: Connect Fastform with Make

Click "Create a webhook":

<Image
  src={CreateWebhook}
  alt="Create Webhook"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Enter the Fastform API key. Learn how to get one from the [API Key tutorial](/docs/api/management/api-key-setup).

<Image src={EnterApiKey} alt="Enter API Key" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

## Step 4: Select Form

Choose from your created forms:

<Image src={Selectform} alt="Select Form" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

## Step 5: Send a test response

You need a test response for Make setup. For local Fastform setup, use the [Demo App](/docs/contributing/demo) to submit a test response.

<Image
  src={SubmitTestResponse}
  alt="Submit Test Response"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Step 6: Set up Google Sheet

Decide on the desired action for the data. Here, we'll send submissions to a Google Sheet:

<Image src={AddModule} alt="Add Module" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

Choose "Add a Row" for the action:

<Image src={SelectAction} alt="Select Action" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

Specify the spreadsheet details and match the Fastform data:

<Image src={SelectFields} alt="Select Fields" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

A new row gets added to the spreadsheet for every response:

<Image src={Result} alt="Result" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />
