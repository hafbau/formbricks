#### Integrations

# n8n Setup

n8n allows you to build flexible workflows focused on deep data integration. And with sharable templates and a user-friendly UI, the less technical people on your team can collaborate on them too. Unlike other tools, complexity is not a limitation. So you can build whatever you want — without stressing over budget. Hook up Fastform with n8n and you can send your data to 350+ other apps. Here is how to do it.

<Note>
  ### Nail down your form first
  Any changes in the form cause additional work in the n8n node. It makes sense to first settle on the form
  you want to run and then get to setting up n8n.
</Note>

## Step 1: Setup your form incl. `questionId` for every question

When setting up the node your life will be easier when you change the `questionId`s of your form questions. You can only do so **before** you publish your form.

<Image src={UpdateQuestionId} alt="Update Question ID" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

_In every question card in the Advanced Settings you find the Question ID field. Update it so that you'll recognize the response tied to this question._

<Note>
  ### Already published? Duplicate form
  You can only update the questionId when the form was not yet published. Already published it? Just **duplicate
  it** to update the questionIds.

    src={Duplicateform}
    alt="Duplicate Form"
    quality="100"
    className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
  />
</Note>

## Step 2: Setup your n8n workflow

Go to [n8n.io](https://n8n.io) and create a new workflow. Search for “Fastform” to get started:

<Image src={AddFormbricksTrigger} alt="Add Fastform Trigger" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

## Step 3: Connect Fastform with n8n

Now, you have to connect n8n with Fastform via an API Key:

<Image src={CreateNewCredentialBtn} alt="Create new credential button" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

Click on Create New Credentail button to add your host and API Key

<Image src={AddApiKey} alt="Add host and api key" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

Now you need an API key. Please refer to the [API Key Setup](/docs/api/management/api-key-setup) page to learn how to create one.

Once you copied it in the API Key field, hit Save button to test the connection and save the credentials.

## Step 4: Select Event

Next, you can choose the event you want to trigger the node on. You can select multiple events:

<Image src={SelectEvent} alt="Select Event" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

Here, we are adding `Response Finished` as an event, which will trigger when the form has been filled out.

## Step 5: Select Form

Next, you can choose from all the forms you have created in this environment. You can select multiple forms:

<Image src={Selectform} alt="Select Form" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

Here, we are selecting two forms.

<Image src={Selectedforms} alt="Selected forms" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

## Step 6: Test your trigger

In order to set up n8n you'll need a test response in the selected form. This allows you to select the individual values of each response in your workflow. If you have Fastform running locally and you want to set up an in-app form, you can use our [Demo App](/docs/contributing/demo) to trigger a form and submit a response.

<Image src={SubmitTestResponse} alt="Submit Test Response" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

Next, click on Listen for event button.

<Image src={ListenForEvent} alt="Listen for event" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

Then, go to the form which you selected. Fill it out, and wait for the particular event to trigger (in this case it's `Response Finished`). Once the event is triggered you will see the response that you filled out in the form.

<Image src={TestResponseSuccess} alt="Test Response Success" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

Now you have all the data you need at hand. The next steps depend on what you want to do with it. In this tutorial, we will send submissions to a discord channel:

## Step 7: Add discord to your workflow

Click on the plus and search `Discord`.

<Image src={AddDiscord} alt="Add Discord" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

Fill in the `Webhook URL` and the `Content` that you want to receive in the respective discord channel. Next, click on `Execute Node` button to test the node.

<Image src={FillDiscordDetails} alt="Fill Discord Details" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />

Once the execution is successful, you'll receive the content in the discord channel.

<Image src={DiscordResponse} alt="Discord Response" quality="100" className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl" />
